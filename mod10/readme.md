# Scikit-Learn Tutorial

Welcome! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook tutorial on Scikit-learn. This Jupyter Notebook is an updated version of the DataQuest tutorial by Satyabrata Pal (2018) found at https://www.dataquest.io/blog/sci-kit-learn-tutorial/. In addition to putting the tutorial in a Jupyter Notebook format, it updates the dataset `url` location since the original is no longer available. It also includes minor updates for new package versions and editorial corrections.  

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11 or earlier
- Jupyter Notebook or VSCode with the Jupyter Notebook extension
- The following Python libraries: Matplotlib, pandas, Seaborn, scikit-learn, and Yellowbrick

You can install the necessary libraries with the following command: `pip install matplotlib==3.6.3 pandas==1.5.3 seaborn==0.12.2 scikit-learn==1.5 yellowbrick==1.5`

Note: Yellowbrick requires the Python standard module `distutils`, which was removed in Python 3.12. Therefore, we recommend using Python 3.11 or earlier for this tutorial.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/ciioprof0/cybv474.git`
2. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repo: `cd <folder-name>`

### If you are using Jupyter Notebook:

3. Start Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook` 

### If you are using VSCode:

3. Open VSCode and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repo. Open the `scikit_learn_tutorial.ipynb` file in VSCode.

4. Open the `scikit_learn_tutorial.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the tutorial.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this tutorial is included in the repo (`WA_Fn-UseC_-Sales-Win-Loss.csv`). It contains sales data that we will analyze using Scikit-Learn.
