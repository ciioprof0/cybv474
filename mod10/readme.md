# Scikit-Learn Tutorial

Welcome to the Scikit-Learn tutorial! This tutorial will guide you through the process of analyzing sales data using the Scikit-Learn library in Python.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11 or earlier
- Jupyter Notebook or VSCode with the Jupyter Notebook extension
- The following Python libraries: Matplotlib, pandas, Seaborn, scikit-learn, and Yellowbrick

You can install the necessary libraries with the following command: `pip install matplotlib==3.6.3 pandas==1.5.3 seaborn==0.12.2 scikit-learn==1.5 yellowbrick==1.5`

Note: Yellowbrick requires the Python standard module `distutils`, which was removed in Python 3.12. Therefore, we recommend using Python 3.11 or earlier for this tutorial.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo to your local machine: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repo: `cd <folder-name>`

### If you are using Jupyter Notebook:


### If you are using VSCode:

3. Open VSCode and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repo. Open the `scikit_learn_tutorial.ipynb` file in VSCode.

4. Open the `scikit_learn_tutorial.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the tutorial.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this tutorial is included in the repo (`WA_Fn-UseC_-Sales-Win-Loss.csv`). It contains sales data that we will analyze using Scikit-Learn.

Enjoy the tutorial, and happy learning!
